# Sequence Flows

<WIP>

## Overview

This document describes the end-to-end execution flows implemented within the CRISP (Credit Risk Intelligence & Strategy Platform).

Unlike the Solution Architecture document, which focuses on structural components, this document illustrates how requests travel through the system during runtime.

The documented flows reflect the implementation completed through Phase 2.

# Sequence Flow Principles

All execution flows follow the same architectural principles:

- User requests always enter through the Coordinator Agent.
- Business logic remains inside specialist agents.
- The Coordinator performs orchestration only.
- Responses are standardized before presentation.
- Logging occurs independently of business logic.
- Services communicate synchronously.

# Flow 1 – Policy Research

# Flow 3 – Policy + Customer Assessment

## Objective

Evaluate a customer against a lending policy.

Current implementation invokes both specialist agents independently before combining their outputs.

                          ▼
                   Streamlit UI
```

**Current Behaviour**

- Both agents execute independently.
- No inter-agent communication occurs.
- The Coordinator aggregates both responses.
- The Response Formatting Service presents a consolidated view.

# Logging Flow

Every request generates two independent audit trails.

```text
User Query
     │
     ▼
Coordinator
     │
     ├────────► Query Logger
     │
     ▼
Agent Invocation
     │
     ▼
Agent Execution Logger
     │
     ▼
JSON Log Files
```

Generated artifacts:

- query_log.json
- agent_execution_log.json

---

# Error Handling Flow

Errors are isolated to the component in which they occur.

```text
Agent
 │
Exception
 │
 ▼
Coordinator
 │
 ▼
Standardized Error Response
 │
 ▼
Response Formatting Service
 │
 ▼
Streamlit UI
```

This prevents infrastructure exceptions from leaking into the presentation layer.

# Planned Evolution

The runtime workflow will continue to evolve as additional capabilities are introduced.

Planned enhancements include:

- Intelligent SLM-based Intent Classification
- Dynamic Agent Registry
- Multi-Agent Workflow Chaining
- Agent Memory
- Confidence Scoring
- Parallel Agent Execution
- Execution Monitoring Dashboard
- Workflow Visualization
